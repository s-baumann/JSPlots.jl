# JSPlots Project Launcher Instructions

This zip file was generated by JSPlots.jl and contains the necessary data files and HTML page to view your plots.

## Viewing the Plots

To view the plots, it is suggested to use one of the launcher scripts to avoid permissions errros that can occur (if you open without heightened permissions the browser won't let the html load data stored on the local disk)

If you cannot use the launcher scripts and cannot launch your browser with higher permissions then you can try to remake the plots with dataformat = :csv_embedded or :json_embedded in JSPlots.jl.
This stores the data in plaintext in the html file so no special permissions are needed to view the plots. That does mean the files are huge though.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome if you find any improvements. Feel free to submit them on the [JSPlots.jl GitHub repository](https://github.com/s-baumann/JSPlots.jl).
